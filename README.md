# quickinstall
Script to install 3d party software on Debian Gnu Linux family distros

Quick install is a simple script to install 3rd party software on debian distros (you know, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc). Using zenity you are able to select a software and click install , and the script will install the software. I know it`s better always to add repos, but I will update the script with repos progressively . You may help me to add new software to this list too. Let me know what you think about it. 
Have fun!
